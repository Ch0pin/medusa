### Description:

**Medusa** is an extensible Reverse Engineering framework for **Android applications** that automate processes and techniques practiced during the **dynamic analysis** of a malware investigation.  

Some of the framework's features are the following:

- Tracing and instrumentation of API calls used by common malware categories
- Tracing and instrumentation of Java and Native functions 
- Unpacking (effective for most of the weel known packers, including Qihoo, Secshell e.t.c.)
- Patching (e.g. autoset the debugable flag)
- Triggering of various system events in order to initiate a malicious behaviour
- Triggering of application's components (Activities, Services e.t.c.)

**Ref: [MEDUSA-Usage-workflows.pdf](https://github.com/Ch0pin/medusa/blob/master/MEDUSA-Usage-workflows.pdf)**


### Usage:

Medusa's functionality is based the following scripts:

- **medusa.py** 

  > Is used to dynamically add or remove tracing of API calls during application's runtime. The tracing 'comes' in a form of modules, where each one of them 'specializes' in an abstract aspect. As an example, to trace the cryptographic procedures of the application (e.g.  fetch AES keys or the plaintext that will be encrypted), simply inject the AES module  and observer the output. 
  >
  > Indicatively some of the  functionalities which are implemented so far, include the following: 
  >
  > -  SSL pinning bypass
  > -  UI restriction bypass (e.g. Flag secure, button enable)
  > -  Class enumeration
  > -  Hook native functions
  > -  Monitoring of:
  >    -  Encryption process (keys, IVs, data to be encrypted)
  >    -  Intents
  >    -  Http communications
  >    -  Websockets
  >    -  Webview events
  >    -  File operations
  >    -  Database interactions
  >    -  Bluetooth operations
  >    -  Clipboard
  > -  Monitoring of API calls used by malware applications, such as:
  >    -  Spyware
  >    -  Click Fraud
  >    -  Toll Fraud
  >    -  Sms Fraud
  >

- **apkutils.py** 

  > Given a **manifest or and apk file**, the specific script is able to perform the following functionalities:
  >
  > - Display the application's components and technical characteristics, including:
  >   - Activities
  >   - Services
  >   - Receivers
  >   - Permissions
  >   - Intent Filters 
  >   - Content providers
  > - Trace application functions 
  > - Trigger an activity, service or an intent
  > - Automate actions performed during dynamic analysis:
  >   - Change device proxy settings
  >   - Capture screenshots of the device
  >   - Install/Uninstall/kill an application
  > - Patch (set the debug flag to true) / Sign / Install 

  **apkutils.py:**

  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4659186/87721141-e3013c00-c7ad-11ea-843c-66eb34d44c96.png" width="7650" height="490">

### Requirements:

See **requirements.txt** for python requirements. 

Additionally:

- Frida installation (preffered version 12.10.4)
- apktool (included in the dependencies folder)
- adb

A rooted device or an emulator is highly recomended in order to use the framework's full capabilities

### Modules:

A module (.med file) consists of three sections. 

- The **'Description'** where the usage of the module is described, e.g. *Description: Use this module to perform the following action* . 

- The **'Help'** where a more detailed information message or even a link to a website providing explanations about the module's usage is inserted

- The **Code** is where the javascript code should be inserted in order to hook a specific API call. 

  What follows is an example of the translation module:

```js

#Description: 'Use this module to translate UI text to english'
#Help: 
"Hooks the setText, setMessage, setTitle functions of basic android UI components 
 and translates the applied text using google's translation API"
#Code:

console.log('\n----------TRANSLATOR SCRIPT -------------');
console.log('----------twiter:@Ch0pin-------------------');
   
    var textViewClass = Java.use("android.widget.TextView");
    var alertDialog = Java.use("android.app.AlertDialog");
    var String = Java.use("java.lang.String");
   

...
    textViewClass.setText.overload('java.lang.CharSequence').implementation = function (originalTxt) {
        var string_to_send = originalTxt.toString();
        var string_to_recv = "";
        send(string_to_send); // send data to python code
        recv(function (received_json_object) {
            string_to_recv = received_json_object.my_data;
        }).wait(); 
        console.log('Translating: ' + string_to_send +" ---> "+ string_to_recv)
  
        var castTostring = String.$new(string_to_recv);

        return this.setText(castTostring);
 
    }

```



### Recipes:

Save a set of modules to a file in order to be used in another session. Simply, export a set of used modules as a recipe by typing: 

**medusa>** export

Import the recipe by simply typing:

**./medusa.py** -r recipe.txt

### ChangeLog:

**08/05/2021:**

- Added busybox support
- Ability to force native library loading

**07/02/2021:**

- **Medusa agent** was modified to include certificate set up functionality as well as a floating mod
- Burp Certificate installation
- Transparent proxy set up

**27/11/2020:** 

Feature added according to which the user can search for code snippets that may later imported to the current session. 

The code snippets are saved in the 'examples' directory and may be imported using the 'import' command, e.g.:

**medusa> import RegisterClass**

The code will be appended to the scratchpad and later get compiled to the final agent script.

**05/11/2020:** 

Added option to dump a specific module from memory

**05/10/2020:** 

- Introducing **Medusa Agent**, to load and explore dex or jar files dropped by APKs:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4659186/95062556-1096bb00-06f5-11eb-9dda-62bfacaa0570.png" alt="medusa_agent" width="230" height="430" />

- Spoof the Notification Listeners
- Hook notification events
- Fixes to dynamic code loading module
- Patch an apk by turning the debug flag to true



**04/11/2020:** More native hook options added:

- Hook by offset
- Hook by pattern



**16/09/2020:** READ/WRITE/SEARCH process memory

By issuing  **medusa> memops** **package_name** **module_name**, the framework can be used to perform read/write operations in the process memory.

```
medusa>memops com.foo.app libfoo.so
